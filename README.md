FEWD assignment 1


## How I got here

Hi there I'm *Olya*. I am a student at *__Front End Web Development programm__*. I was born and raised in **Belarus**, small country in the heart of Europe. I always dreamed to live by the sea since I was a little girl. My friend at university told me about Green Card Lottery and I decided to take a shot and turned out I won on the first time! It was one of the happiest moments of my life. 


### Story from my childhood

When I was a little my retired grandfather surprisingly received a huge package with sweets from his student graduated from school 20 years ago and moved to America.
There were a lot of: 
* cookies, 
* chocolates, 
* chewing gums, 
* etc. 


Grandfather was the principal of the school.
In the early 90's in our country there were no foreign sweets in stores, we could only see them on TV. And thanks to that package of gratitude to my grandfather - first time in my life I tried Snickers). It was the longest time of eating one chocolate bar in my childhood - I  took the time to enjoy it.)
20 years later I moved to USA and I think that Snickers played a part in this.
